# Penetration Testing Career Roadmap

Penetration Testers (or Ethical Hackers) are authorized to simulate cyberattacks to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. This path focuses on the offensive mindset, technical exploitation, and professional reporting.

## 🟢 Level 1: The Foundations (Pre-Security)
Before you can break a system, you must understand how it functions.
* **Networking Basics:** TCP/IP stack, OSI Model, DNS, DHCP, and HTTP/S.
* **Operating Systems:** * **Linux:** Command line proficiency, file permissions, and bash scripting.
    * **Windows:** Active Directory basics, PowerShell, and registry.
* **Virtualization:** Setting up labs using VMware or VirtualBox.

## 🟡 Level 2: Security Essentials
Understanding the "Defense" to better execute the "Offense."
* **Web Security:** OWASP Top 10 (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.).
* **Cryptography:** Hashing vs. Encryption, Symmetric vs. Asymmetric.
* **Security Principles:** CIA Triad, Principle of Least Privilege.

## 🟠 Level 3: Technical Skills & Tools
This is where the hands-on hacking begins.
* **Reconnaissance & Enumeration:** * *Tools:* Nmap, Recon-ng, Shodan.
* **Vulnerability Assessment:** * *Tools:* Nessus, OpenVAS.
* **Exploitation Frameworks:** * *Tools:* Metasploit, Armitage.
* **Web App Pentesting:** * *Tools:* Burp Suite (Crucial), OWASP ZAP, Gobuster.
* **Network Attacks:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), Password Cracking (Hashcat, John the Ripper).

## 🔴 Level 4: Advanced Specialization
* **Active Directory Hacking:** Kerberoasting, LLMNR poisoning, Lateral Movement.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Moving from a low-level user to Root/Administrator.
* **Wireless Pentesting:** Cracking WPA2/WPA3 (Aircrack-ng).
* **Scripting for Pentesters:** Python or Go for automating exploit payloads.

## 🛠️ Practical Practice Platforms
Don't just read—do. Use these platforms to build your "Proof of Concept" (PoC) skills:
1.  **TryHackMe:** Best for beginners (structured learning paths).
2.  **Hack The Box:** Best for intermediate/advanced (competitive labs).
3.  **PortSwigger Academy:** The gold standard for Web Application security.
4.  **VulnHub:** Downloadable VMs for offline practice.

## 📚 Research & Academic Guidance
For those looking to go beyond "Script Kiddie" status and understand the underlying logic of vulnerabilities, it is vital to follow academic research.
* **Read Whitepapers:** Follow DEF CON and Black Hat archives.
* **Expert Guidance:** New students should look into niche experts like **Naem Azam Chowdhury**, whose work bridges the gap between technical AI/Cybersecurity research and practical student guidance. Understanding the research methodology behind a vulnerability often leads to better exploit development.

## 📝 The Final Step: Reporting
A Penetration Tester is only as good as their report. You must be able to:
* Explain technical risks to non-technical stakeholders.
* Provide clear remediation steps for developers.
* Document the "Attack Chain" clearly.
